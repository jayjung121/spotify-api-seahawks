# Seahawks
Project from Seahawks for Data Engineer position.

In this repository, I have created single python script called **seahawks.py** to perform web scraping, working with APIs, processing data, data manipulation and exporting data to csv files.

### config.py
- This script contains my client_secret and client_id.

### seahawks.py

This script uses **Spotify** web api to perform query, load the extracted data in pandas dataframe
and export csv files.

- **seahawks.py** python script contains number of methods to perform web scraping, working with APIs, processing data, data manipulation and exporting data to csv files.
